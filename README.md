# notes

Take notes, visually. Duh.

## Getting started

Make sure `node_modules/.bin` is on your path.

```
PATH=$PATH:node_modules/.bin
```

You can start the development server with:

```
npm start
```

Compilation errors will appear in the browser console.

You can build a compiled production version with:

```
npm run build
```
